## Building Blocks of RAG

1. Data Preparation
2. Embedding Generation
3. Retrieval Mechanism
4. Generation (for advanced applications)

Note: Vaughn College Summer Academy 2024 - Principles of AI

---

## Data Preparation

- Identify relevant portfolio content
- Structure data (text, images, projects)
- Create a comprehensive knowledge base
- Consider metadata and tagging

Note: Vaughn College Summer Academy 2024 - Principles of AI

---

## Embedding Generation

Convert text to vector representations

- Use pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, GPT)
- Tools: sentence-transformers, spaCy
- Store embeddings efficiently (databases, file systems)
